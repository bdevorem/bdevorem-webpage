					<br></p></h5>
					<p style="text-index: 40px">
						In all seriousness, I do enjoy living 
                        in Indiana because that's where I
                        get to explore my passions. I am 
                        absolutely in love with computer 
                        science.
						<br><br>
						<b><span style="color: red;">Moment of silence for that clich√©.</span></b>
						<br><br>
						The feeling is actually quite hard to explain... 
						It's like I just can't get enough of 
						computer science. I keep
						yearning for more. Everything I have learned has 
						intrigued me, tested me, pulled out the childlike
						curiosity in me - and I know I've only had a tiny 
						taste of all that's out there. By the way, that
						tiny taste is better than any guac I have ever
						consumed.
						I'm lucky enough to be in 
                        a position where I get to satisfy my 
						need to learn every single day, which
						just fuels my passions. The 
                        more I learn, the more I want to learn.

                        Cyber security is the field that constantly
						piques my interests, but I have always
						been a theory person. I am intrigued by
						the practice of creating secure code
						and software, however my main interests
						lie in programming languages and their construction,
						especially the area where security meets
						language design. 
                        <br>
						My interests 
                        are not just singular though. I love
                        PL, but I also am interested in optimization,
						automata theory, systems, and hacking on all things
						Linux. I am also curious about software development, 
						AI, and computer science education, but I 
						lack experience in those fields.
						<br>
						<br>
						In the summer of 2015, I lived in Ireland where 
                        I interned at IBM Research Dublin. 
						That summer was phenomenal for many reasons,
						but mainly because it was my first
						experience performing computer science research.
						If there is anything in life that I am meant to
						do, it's to spend my life studying computer science
						and trying to tackle those unanswered questions that
						may (will) keep me up for days on end. 
						The work I did
						and the people I met allowed me to come to
						that realization, which solidified my previously
						shaky intent to pursue PL research and
						graduate education. Now, I can't imagine a future for
						myself that doesn't consist of research.
						<br>
                        After that internship, I feel like I came 
						alive in my education. My work made me a 
						better coder and a more well-rounded 
                        person, but doing research gave me a strange
						energy that made me want to soak up every second
						of my education and every bit of knowledge that I 
						absolutely could. If that doesn't tell you I'm
						meant for research, nothing else will.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For the summer of 2016, I am a research
						intern for IBM once again, this time at 
						the Almaden Valley Research 
                        Center in San Jose. Stay tuned for updates!
