						I'm from Northern California and I love winter. Just kidding.
					<br></p></h5>
					<p style="text-index: 40px">
						In all seriousness, I do enjoy living 
                        in Indiana because that's where I
                        get to explore my passions. I am 
                        absolutely in love with computer 
                        science. It seems easy and typical
						to state that sentence as a CS undergrad,
						but I feel like I can never get 
						enough of computer science. I always
						want to learn more because I have only
						had a small taste of the vast expansion
						of knowledge right at my fingertips, 
						and that small taste is better than 
						any guac I have ever consumed. 
						I'm lucky enough to be in 
                        a position where I get to satisfy my 
						need to learn, every single day, which
						just fuels my passions. The 
                        more I learn, the more I want to learn.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Cyber security is the field that constantly
						piques my interests, but I have always
						been a theory person. I am intrigued by
						the practice of creating secure code
						and software, however my main interests
						lie in programming languages and their construction,
						especially the area where security meets
						language design. 
                        <br>
						My interests 
                        are not just singular though. I love
                        PL, but I also am interested in optimization,
						automata theory, and hacking on all things
						Linux. I am also curious about software development, 
						AI, and computer science education, but I 
						lack experience in those fields.

                        In the summer of 2015, I lived in Ireland where 
                        I interned at IBM Research Dublin. 
						That summer was phenomenal for many reasons,
						but mainly because it was my first
						experience performing computer science research.
						I had always thought about eventually
						pursuing a PhD, but I never knew exactly
						what it would entail or even if it 
						was right for me. Well, the work I did
						and the people I met really solidified
						my intent to pursue PL research and
						graduate education,
						and now I feel like I was made for it.
						I can't imagine a future for
						myself that doesn't consist of research.
						<br>
                        After that internship, I felt like a 
						better coded and a more well-rounded 
                        person. I learned how easy it is 
						to get caught up 
                        in assignments and projects during the 
                        academic year, but more importantly
						I learned how to take a step back
						and gain some perspective. 
                        After a summer of 
                        not being a student, I somehow learned 
                        how to be a better student. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For the summer of 2016, I am a research
						intern for IBM once again, this time at 
						the Almaden Valley Research 
                        Center in San Jose. Stay tuned for updates!
